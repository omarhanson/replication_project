    <h1>Benefits of  Honey</h1> 
 </div>
</div>
<div class="flexcontainer1">

<div class="column1 ">    
    <h4>Rich in Antioxidants</h4>
    <p>
        Many of us enjoy honey and incorporate it into our daily diet,  whether as 
         a natural sugar substitute for our coffee or simply  as a sweet treat. But 
        specific honey varietals known as "active" honeys have also been utilised 
         throughout history for their antibacterial and medicinal properties.
    </p>

</div>


<div class="column1   ">
    <h4>Natural Cough Medicine</h4>
    <p>
         Honey is a time-honored remedy for a sore throat. According to one study 
        , it can also relieve coughs moreeffectively than OTC medications that
        contain dextromethorphan (DM), a cough suppressant. You can create
        your own remedy at home by mixing up to 2 teaspoons of honey with 
        herbal tea or warm water and lemon.</p>

  
</div>


<div class=" column1  ">
    <h4>Lowers Blood Pressure</h4>
    <p>
       Blood pressure is an important risk factor for heart disease, and honey 
       may help lower it. This  is because it contains antioxidants compounds that 
       have been linked to lower blood pressure. Studies in both rats and humans 
       have shown modest reductions in blood pressure from consuming honey. 

    </p>
</div>
       
 </div> 
 

<div class="flexcontainer2">

<div class="col2">
    <h4>Improves Cholesterol</h4>
    <p>
        Studies have shown that consuming honey lowers LDL (bad) cholesteral 
        by 6-11% and lowers triglycerde levels by as much as 11%. Honey may 
        also increase HDL (good) cholesteral by about 3%.
    </p>
</div>


<div class="col2">

    <h4 >Improves Heart Health</h4>
    <p>
        It's high in antioxidants, such as phenolic acids and flavonoids, which may 
        support better health. Small studies in humans show honey's antioxidants 
        could help improve cholesteral levels, which could helpdecrease the risk 
        for heart disease, although larger long-term studies are needed to confirm 
         those findings.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="col2">
    <h4  >Antibacterial properties</h4>
    <p>
    
        Honey contains hydrogen peroxide, which may account for some of its 
        antibacterial properties. It also has a high sugar content, which can help 
        stop the growth of certain bacteria. Additionally, honey has a low <small>p</small>H level. 
        This works to pull moisture away from bacteria, causing the bacteria to get 
        dehydrated and die off.

            I have been trying to embrace a more holistic life style and 
            focusing on having a more natural, low processing and 
            preservation diet. I have  opted to reduce my sugarintake and 
            change outto honey. I feel more assure that MTA 
            honey valley is of the purest form as I have seen the GMPs 
            employed by this company and haveconfidence in their 
              ethical practices. I also used honey in my skin care routine and have been seeing  big 
            positive changes.

        I have been a big user of honey for years now for several 
        reasons,  health being number 1. And over the years I have 
        tried numerous brand of honey and I was always satisfied with 
         the quality of them, until I tried MTA Honey Valley. The 
         quality of Honey Valley's honey is second to none.Ever since I tried 
         the first bottle I have not used another brand since and I have absolutely no intention 
        of using any. The product quality is exceptional and the customer 
        service from the MTA Honey valley team istop notch. MTA 
        Honey Valley, You Guys are the best !!!!

        MTA honey is natural sweet and delicious. I work away from 
        Jamaica and for the last five years I always bring with me a  
        bottle which i put pegs of garlic into and used to booast 
        my immune system.
